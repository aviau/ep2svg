ep2svg
======

Tool to convert .ep files (http://pencil.evolus.vn/) to SVG

I have found this here: https://code.google.com/p/evoluspencil/issues/detail?id=260#c1

The github repository of the author is not longer available so I decided to post this here.


Usage:
```
ep2svg.sh <mockup1.ep> <mockup2.ep> ...
```
